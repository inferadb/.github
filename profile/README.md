__InferaDB is an open, inference-driven authorization database for modern, distributed systems.__

Inspired by Google Zanzibar, standardized by AuthZEN, and evolved through the principles of inference and reasoning, InferaDB models relationships as data and policies as logic. Its strongly consistent, low-latency architecture allows developers to perform fine-grained access checks at scale — across services, regions, and tenants — with complete auditability and deterministic behavior.

Designed for engineers who value clarity and control, InferaDB unifies authorization storage, policy evaluation, and logic execution into a single reasoning layer. Built in Rust for performance and safety, and orchestrated with TypeScript for accessibility, it delivers a best-in-class developer experience through modern SDKs, a robust CLI, and an intuitive dashboard.
