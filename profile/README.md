__*in·fer·uh·dee·bee* (n.) — Authorization, solved.__

High-performance, fine-grained authorization at scale. InferaDB uses hardware-accelerated graph traversal and distributed computing to infer access decisions from your relationships, attributes, policies, and context — every decision logged to an immutable ledger, cryptographically signed and replayable.

- **Flexibility** — ReBAC, RBAC, ABAC, visual policy design, WebAssembly
- **Performance** — Hardware-accelerated, decentralized, parallel distributed compute
- **Operations** — Immutable audit ledger, cryptographic audit trails, native observability
- **Reliability** — Self-optimizing, self-healing
