__InferaDB is an open, inference-driven authorization database for modern, distributed systems.__

Inspired by Google Zanzibar, standardized by AuthZEN, and built on inference principles, InferaDB models relationships as data and policies as logic. Its strongly consistent, low-latency architecture lets developers perform fine-grained access checks at scale — across services, regions, and tenants — with auditability and deterministic behavior.

Designed for engineers who value clarity and control, InferaDB unifies authorization storage, policy evaluation, and logic execution into one reasoning layer. Built in Rust for performance and safety, orchestrated with TypeScript for accessibility, it delivers a polished developer experience through SDKs, CLI, and dashboard.
