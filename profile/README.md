__*in·fer·uh·dee·bee* (n.) — Authorization, solved.__

Authorization shouldn't be fragile. InferaDB makes fine-grained access control fast and scalable with hardware-accelerated distributed graph traversal and a decentralized architecture that runs anywhere. Compose policies visually or go deeper with custom WebAssembly logic. Every decision is logged to a cryptographically signed, immutable ledger. [Zanzibar](https://research.google/pubs/zanzibar-googles-consistent-global-authorization-system/)-inspired. [AuthZEN](https://openid.net/wg/authzen/)-compliant. Zero lock-in.

- **Flexibility** — ReBAC, RBAC, ABAC, visual policy design, WebAssembly
- **Performance** — Hardware-accelerated, decentralized, parallel distributed compute
- **Operations** — Immutable audit ledger, cryptographic audit trails, native observability
- **Reliability** — Self-optimizing, self-healing
