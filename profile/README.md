__*in·fer·uh·db* (n.) — Authorization, solved.__

Hardware-accelerated, self-optimizing, cryptographically provable. Every decision is inferred from your policies, logic, and context — traceable and replayable.

- **Flexibility** — ReBAC, RBAC, ABAC, visual policy design, WebAssembly
- **Performance** — Hardware-accelerated, parallel distributed compute
- **Operations** — Cryptographic audit trails, native observability
- **Reliability** — Self-optimizing, self-healing
